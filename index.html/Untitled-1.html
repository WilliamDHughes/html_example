    <h3>Quokka Description</h3>

    <p>Quokkas are found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, particularly Rottnest Island just off Perth and Bald Island near Albany.</p>

    <p>Isolated, scattered populations also exist in forest and coastal heath between Perth and Albany.</p>

    <p>The word "quokka" is originally derived from a Noongar word, which was probably gwaga.[14] Today, the Noongar people refer to them as ban-gup, bungeup and quaka.</p>

    <p>These herbivorous marsupials like to swallow their food whole without chewing, then regurgitate it later and eat it again. Their diet consists of native grasses and leaves as well as the bark of some plants.</p>

    <p>Due to habitat destruction, climate change and invasive predators, quokkas are listed as Vulnerable to extinction under Australias national environment law.</p>

    <p>In the mid-2010s, quokkas earned a reputation on the internet as "the world's happiest animals" and symbols of positivity, as frontal photos of their faces make them appear to be smiling (they do not, in fact "smile" in the human sense; this can be attributed to their natural facial structures). Many photos of smiling quokkas have since gone viral, and the "quokka selfie" has become a popular social media trend, with celebrities such as Chris Hemsworth, Shawn Mendes, Margot Robbie, Roger Federer and Kim Donghyuk of iKON. Tourist numbers to Rottnest Island have subsequently increased</p>
